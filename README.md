## README - Kalibro Configurations

Kalibro Configurations is a source code analysis configuration web service
which is also part of the Mezuro project. It is free software under the AGPLv3
license.

It was strongly based on the vintage Kalibro (https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro)
written in Java mostly by Carlos Morais (carlos88morais at gmail dot com)
on his MSc dissertation (in portuguese http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-25092013-142158/en.php)

### Development

* System dependencies (Ubuntu package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

  * postgresql-server-dev-9.3


  **NOTE:** The version of postgresql may vary accordingly with your system
  version

* Ruby version

  2.3.0

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM.
  Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  It is expected to work with:

  * 2.1.5 Debian 8
  * 2.0.0 CentOS 7


  **NOTE:** If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivative like
  terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login
  bash".

* Configuration

      ./bin/setup

  This will create all the configuration files with defaults for Ubuntu and
  initialize your database.

* How to run the test suite

      rake

* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistrano
  (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

      cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have your ssh key set at the target server.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at `config/deploy.rb`.

### Install

* First Deploy

  1.  Make sure that the deployment files (`config/deploy.rb`
      `config/deploy/production.rb` are correctly configured to the
      installation server;
  2.  Also, make sure that the installation server already has rvm
      installed;

      * It should already have the ruby version installed with the gemset created as well

  1.  Check if everything is OK for deploy:
          cap production deploy:check

  2.  Finally deploy with:
          cap production deploy
